Programs written in C to solve the puzzles of the https://adventofcode.com/2020[Advent of Code 2020].

== Repository Structure

Each day of the advent calendar (with its puzzle) has its separate folder.
Each solution of these folders is (logically) independent of the other solutions and is comprised by a single `main.c` file, the `input` file containing the puzzle data and a `Makefile`.
