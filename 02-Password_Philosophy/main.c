 * Advent of Code - Day 2: Password Philosophy
 *
 * Your flight departs in a few days from the coastal airport; the easiest way
 * down to the coast from here is via toboggan.
 *
 * The shopkeeper at the North Pole Toboggan Rental Shop is having a bad day.
 * "Something's wrong with our computers; we can't log in!" You ask if you can
 * take a look.
 *
 * Their password database seems to be a little corrupted: some of the
 * passwords wouldn't have been allowed by the Official Toboggan Corporate
 * Policy that was in effect when they were chosen.
 *
 * To try to debug the problem, they have created a list (your puzzle input) of
 * passwords (according to the corrupted database) and the corporate policy
 * when that password was set.
 *
 * For example, suppose you have the following list:
 *
 * 1-3 a: abcde
 * 1-3 b: cdefg
 * 2-9 c: ccccccccc
 *
 * Each line gives the password policy and then the password. The password
 * policy indicates the lowest and highest number of times a given letter must
 * appear for the password to be valid. For example, 1-3 a means that the
 * password must contain a at least 1 time and at most 3 times.
 *
 * In the above example, 2 passwords are valid. The middle password, cdefg, is
 * not; it contains no instances of b, but needs at least 1. The first and
 * third passwords are valid: they contain one a or nine c, both within the
 * limits of their respective policies.
 *
 * How many passwords are valid according to their policies?
