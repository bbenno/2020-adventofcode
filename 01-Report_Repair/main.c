 * Advent of Code - Day 1: Report Repair
 *
 * After saving Christmas five years in a row, you've decided to take a
 * vacation at a nice resort on a tropical island. Surely, Christmas will go on
 * without you.
 *
 * The tropical island has its own currency and is entirely cash-only. The gold
 * coins used there have a little picture of a starfish; the locals just call
 * them stars. None of the currency exchanges seem to have heard of them, but
 * somehow, you'll need to find fifty of these coins by the time you arrive so
 * you can pay the deposit on your room.
 *
 * To save your vacation, you need to get all fifty stars by December 25th.
 *
 * Collect stars by solving puzzles. Two puzzles will be made available on each
 * day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete
 * the first. Each puzzle grants one star. Good luck!
 *
 * Before you leave, the Elves in accounting just need you to fix your expense
 * report (your puzzle input); apparently, something isn't quite adding up.
 *
 * Specifically, they need you to find the two entries that sum to 2020 and
 * then multiply those two numbers together.
 *
 * For example, suppose your expense report contained the following:
 *
 * 1721
 * 979
 * 366
 * 299
 * 675
 * 1456
 *
 * In this list, the two entries that sum to 2020 are 1721 and 299. Multiplying
 * them together produces 1721 * 299 = 514579, so the correct answer is 514579.
 *
 * Of course, your expense report is much larger. Find the two entries that sum
 * to 2020; what do you get if you multiply them together?
 *
 * --- Part Two ---
 *
 *  The Elves in accounting are thankful for your help; one of them even offers
 *  you a starfish coin they had left over from a past vacation. They offer you
 *  a second one if you can find three numbers in your expense report that meet
 *  the same criteria.
 *
 *  Using the above example again, the three entries that sum to 2020 are 979,
 *  366, and 675. Multiplying them together produces the answer, 241861950.
 *
 *  In your expense report, what is the product of the three entries that sum
 *  to 2020?
