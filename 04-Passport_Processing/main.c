 * Advent of Code - Day 4: Passport Processing
 *
 * You arrive at the airport only to realize that you grabbed your North Pole
 * Credentials instead of your passport. While these documents are extremely
 * similar, North Pole Credentials aren't issued by a country and therefore
 * aren't actually valid documentation for travel in most of the world.
 *
 * It seems like you're not the only one having problems, though; a very long
 * line has formed for the automatic passport scanners, and the delay could
 * upset your travel itinerary.
 *
 * Due to some questionable network security, you realize you might be able to
 * solve both of these problems at the same time.
 *
 * The automatic passport scanners are slow because they're having trouble
 * detecting which passports have all required fields. The expected fields are
 * as follows:
 *
 * - byr (Birth Year)
 * - iyr (Issue Year)
 * - eyr (Expiration Year)
 * - hgt (Height)
 * - hcl (Hair Color)
 * - ecl (Eye Color)
 * - pid (Passport ID)
 * - cid (Country ID)
 *
 * Passport data is validated in batch files (your puzzle input). Each passport
 * is represented as a sequence of key:value pairs separated by spaces or
 * newlines. Passports are separated by blank lines.
 *
 * Here is an example batch file containing four passports:
 *
 * ecl:gry pid:860033327 eyr:2020 hcl:#fffffd
 * byr:1937 iyr:2017 cid:147 hgt:183cm
 *
 * iyr:2013 ecl:amb cid:350 eyr:2023 pid:028048884
 * hcl:#cfa07d byr:1929
 *
 * hcl:#ae17e1 iyr:2013
 * eyr:2024
 * ecl:brn pid:760753108 byr:1931
 * hgt:179cm
 *
 * hcl:#cfa07d eyr:2025 pid:166559648
 * iyr:2011 ecl:brn hgt:59in
 *
 * The first passport is valid - all eight fields are present. The second
 * passport is invalid - it is missing hgt (the Height field).
 *
 * The third passport is interesting; the only missing field is cid, so it
 * looks like data from North Pole Credentials, not a passport at all! Surely,
 * nobody would mind if you made the system temporarily ignore missing cid
 * fields. Treat this "passport" as valid.
 *
 * The fourth passport is missing two fields, cid and byr. Missing cid is fine,
 * but missing any other field is not, so this passport is invalid.
 *
 * According to the above rules, your improved system would report 2 valid
 * passports.
 *
 * Count the number of valid passports - those that have all required fields.
 * Treat cid as optional. In your batch file, how many passports are valid?

/*
 * Author's assumptions about input:
 * 1. No line exceeds 149 character (inclusive newline).
 * 2. No (inconsistent) duplicate key entries per passport.
